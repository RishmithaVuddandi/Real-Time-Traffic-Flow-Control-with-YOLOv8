In this study, we developed a comprehensive traffic monitoring and prediction system combining YOLOv8 and the Prophet model. YOLOv8 was employed for real-time vehicle detection and categorization, achieving a high degree of accuracy in identifying vehicle types (e.g., cars, buses, and trucks) and providing reliable vehicle count estimates. To forecast traffic trends, the Prophet model utilized historical data to capture seasonal patterns and fluctuations, complementing YOLOv8's real-time detection capabilities. The system was implemented in an interactive Dash application, enabling users to visualize real-time traffic data and forecasted trends for selected junctions, with customizable forecast periods. Our system achieved a precision of 84.29, recall of 76.70, and an F1 score of 80.32, underscoring its effectiveness in dynamic traffic management.
